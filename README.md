# GASNet: Progressive Resolution-Aware Supervision and Gabor Guidance for Accurate Liver Vessel Segmentation

GASNet is a novel deep learning framework designed for high-precision liver vessel segmentation in CT scans. It addresses challenges such as fine vessel continuity, scale variance, and low contrast by integrating three key components:

- An **adaptive ConvNeXt backbone** for hierarchical feature extraction,
- A **learnable Gabor multi-filter module** for vessel-aware structural guidance,
- A **progressive resolution-aware supervision** mechanism for deep multi-scale learning.
